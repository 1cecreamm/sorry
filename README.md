# Will You Be My Valentine? üíå

## How It Works üõ†Ô∏è

This project consists of a simple webpage with a "Yes" and "No" button. When the user clicks the "No" button, the button text changes to a series of playful messages, and the "Yes" button grows larger. If the user clicks the "Yes" button, they are redirected to a new page (`yes_page.html`), which could display a celebratory message or animation.

### Features:
- **Interactive Buttons**: The "No" button cycles through funny and persuasive messages, while the "Yes" button grows in size.
- **Cute GIF**: A heartwarming GIF is displayed to set the mood.
- **Responsive Design**: The webpage is designed to work on all screen sizes.
